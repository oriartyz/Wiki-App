# Wiki-App



<br>
The goal of this project is to code a search system using the Wikipedia API.<br>
The user can perform a search and see results that he can click on if he wants to move on the page of the article in question.<br> 
<br>
<br>

###  JavaScript Features to Code for this Project

1. Handle search input using the form and input.
2. Use the Wikipedia API to obtain the search results. <br>

Here's the endpoint (URL) because it's one of the first projects and the documentation is not very clear:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&format=json&origin=*&srlimit=20&srsearch=${searchInput}

-Use the API using the fetch() method, including the search content here: ${searchInput}.

3. Add a loader while loading.
4. Display the results below the input.
5. Make it possible to perform as many searches as desired.
